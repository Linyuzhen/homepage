## About Me

I am a researcher at [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/), focusing on multimedia forensics and security. My research specializes in deepfake detection, image forgery analysis, and audio steganography. I am passionate about developing robust and generalizable solutions for multimedia content authentication and security in the era of generative AI.

## Research Interests

- **Multimedia Forensics:** Deepfake detection, image forgery detection and localization, video manipulation detection
- **Multimedia Security:** Audio steganography, face identity protection, privacy-preserving techniques
- **Computer Vision:** Generative models, face processing, domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning
- **Machine Learning:** Knowledge distillation, curriculum learning, robust feature learning
