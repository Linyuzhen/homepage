## About Me

I am a researcher at Shenzhen University, focusing on multimedia forensics and security. My research specializes in deepfake detection, image forgery analysis, and audio steganography.

## Research Interests

- **Multimedia Forensics:** deepfake detection, image forgery detection and localization
- **Multimedia Security:** audio steganography, face identity protection
- **Computer Vision:** generative models, face processing, domain adaptation

## News

- **[Mar. 2024]** Our paper "A Quality-Centric Framework for Generic Deepfake Detection" is available on arXiv.
- **[Feb. 2024]** Our paper "Standing on the shoulders of giants: Reprogramming visual-language model for general deepfake detection" is available on arXiv.
- **[Jan. 2024]** Our paper "Diffforensics: Leveraging diffusion prior to image forgery detection and localization" has been accepted to CVPR 2024.
- **[Nov. 2023]** Our paper "Detection of Photoplethysmography Manipulation in Video Forgery" was presented at EUSIPCO 2023.
